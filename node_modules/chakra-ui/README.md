# **Welcome to Chakra UI ‚ö°Ô∏è**

- Works out of the box. Chakra UI contains a set of polished React components that work out of the box.

- Flexible & composable. Chakra UI components are built on top of a React UI Primitive for endless composability.

- Accessible. Chakra UI components follows the WAI-ARIA guidelines specifications.

- Dark Mode üòç: All components work in dark mode compatible.

## Install and use components

‚ö°Ô∏èChakra UI is made up of multiple components and tools which you can import one by one. All you need to do is install the `chakra-ui` package:

```sh
$ yarn add chakra-ui
# or
$ npm install --save chakra-ui
```

A working version, assuming you are using something like [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), might look like this:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Button } from "chakra-ui";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Button>I just consumed some ‚ö°Ô∏èChakra!</Button>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
